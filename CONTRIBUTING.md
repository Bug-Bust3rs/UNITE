## Important Ways to Contribute

Here are some key areas where you can make a difference:

a. **Add a New Feature in Frontend ✨**
   - We’re always looking to expand our library of frontend components. If you have a cool feature or component that isn’t currently covered, feel free to create and contribute it. Ensure your contribution is well-documented and follows our coding standards.

   *If you want to add a new frontend feature, please place it inside the `apps/frontend` directory.*

b. **Add a New Feature in Backend 🚀**
   - Have an idea for improving our backend? Whether it’s optimizing code, adding new endpoints, or enhancing existing ones, we’d love your input. Contributions can include performance tweaks, better documentation, or any other improvements you can think of.

   *If you want to enhance existing backend features or APIs, please work inside the `apps/backend` directories.*

c. **Fix Bugs in Website 🐛**
   - Our website helps users understand and use UNITE. You can contribute by fixing bugs, adding new features, or improving the overall design and user experience. If you’re skilled in frontend development, we’d love your help here!

   *If you want to contribute to the UNITE documentation, please work inside the `docs` directory. The `apps/frontend` subdirectory is for the React js frontend and the `apps/backend` subdirectory is for the Node.js Express backend.*

4. **Make Your Changes 💻**
   - Implement your changes in your new branch. Ensure your code follows the project's coding standards and is well-documented.

5. **Commit and Push 🚢**
   - Commit your changes with a clear and descriptive commit message:
     ```bash
     git commit -m "Description of your changes"
     ```
   - Push your changes to your forked repository:
     ```bash
     git push origin feature/your-feature-name
     ```

6. **Create a Pull Request 🔄**
   - Head back to the original repository on GitHub and create a pull request from your branch to dev branch. Provide a detailed description of your changes and why they should be merged.

## 🚨 Important Notice 🚨

All contributions must be made through the `dev` branch. If you create a pull request to the `main` branch, it will be automatically rejected.
